# Forum-web

## Introduction
For my project I decided to make a Forum Website where users can share a post about an idea they would like to discuss or raise an issue. Other users can then view the post and add their own comment to give their opinions to discuss about the post. 

The following is how CRUD functionailty will be implemented.

Create:
* A brand new post
* A new comment in a post that have already been created

Read:
* Any posts that have already been created
* Any comments that have already been created

Update:
* Any posts that have already been created
* Any comments that have already been created

Delete:
* Any posts that have already been created
* Any comments that have already been created
